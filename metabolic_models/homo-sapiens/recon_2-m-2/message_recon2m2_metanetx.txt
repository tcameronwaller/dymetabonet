Message subject: request to contribute to MetaNetX

Dear Dr. Marco Pagni and MetaNetX Team,

I'm writing to ask how to contribute to MetaNetX. This project impresses me very much, and I agree that it's extremely helpful to have a resource for standardization and comparison of information from metabolic models.

For my own project, I'm using information from the recent Recon 2M.2 model of human metabolism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078384). I'm not an original author of this model, but I made several modifications to improve its reconciliation into MetaNetX's name space. I'd like to make this model available to the community in MetaNetX.

I'm working towards incorporating PubChem identifiers for metabolites in MetaNetX's name space. These PubChem identifiers will be useful to associate data from the Metabolomics Workbench (http://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/). There are also some minor curation-type improvements that I'd like to make to descriptions of many metabolites in MetaNetX.

How can I submit changes for your review for inclusion in MetaNetX?

My account on GitHub is "tcameronwaller" (https://github.com/tcameronwaller).

Thanks,
