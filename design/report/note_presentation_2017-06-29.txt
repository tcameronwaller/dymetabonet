Title
"Visualization and Analysis of Sets and Entities in Metabolism"

--------------------------------------------------
Section: Introduction
--------------------------------------------------

----------
Slide

Goal of project is to understand properties and relationships in metabolism.
Entities of interest include metabolites, reactions (genes, transcripts, proteins), processes (pathways), and compartments.
Relations between these entities are also of interest.

The term "pathway" implies linearity.
I prefer the term "process" to represent cooperativity and nonlinearity.

There are many potential directions to take in support of the study of the metabolic network.

----------
Slide

A and B are processes or compartments in metabolism.
How does A compare to B (cardinality)?
Which compartment has more reactions, the cytosol or the mitochondrion?

----------
Slide

A and B are processes or compartments in metabolism.
How does A relate to B (common elements)?
How many metabolites occur in both the mitochondrion and the peroxisome?

----------
Slide

A is a metabolite or reaction in metabolism.
What metabolites and reactions relate to A?
Which reactions involve pyruvate?

Slide

Exploration, specific interest

In metabolism, there are many entities and sets with many properties.
It is important to give dynamice access to different aspects of information in sufficient detail.

----------
Slide

Scale
Count of metabolites: _____
Count of reactions: _____

Connectivity
Many-to-many

----------
Slide

Connectivity
-Small-world
--Common in biological networks (evolutionary pattern), social networks, and the internet server network
--In small-world networks, a few metabolites, genes, transcripts, proteins, people, or servers are extremely influential

Slide

Source data
Model of human metabolism
File in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), 23 MB
Convert to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), 4 MB
Check, clean, and organize data, 4 MB

Summarize counts of entities and sets and information available for each

----------
Slide

Collect and organize attributes for each entity within a table
Table allows simple summary and filtration

----------
Slide

Abstraction
Summarize metabolism in sets of entities by attributes
Set cardinality (count of elements)
Selections of values of attributes define filters for entities

Definition of network
Replication of nodes for common metabolites
Metabolites with most reactions in metabolism are also the most common in the cell, and probably not especially interesting

Slide

Definition of network
General metabolites versus compartmental metabolites
Preference depends on interest
Counts of general and compartmental metabolites
