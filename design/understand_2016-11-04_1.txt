"Understand"
"goal: gather, observe, and research available information to find the needs of the user"
"artifacts: design requirements"

--------------------------------------------------
"1) identify the challenge & users"
"think big! what is the problem? who is affected by it? what is known/unknown? orient yourself with all of the project's who, what, why, when, & how."

The biological study of metabolism has potential to promote the domains of biotechnology, pharmacology, and medicine.
Thereby, this study has potential to benefit human health.
Metabolism is a complex system.
The experimental study of metabolism involves large and complex data sets that are difficult to interpret.
Interpretation requires consideration for the complex metabolic system.
Prospective users are investigators in the domains of biotechnology, pharmacology, and medicine who study metabolism.
Users have very variable familiarity and expertise in metabolism, and data analysis.

--------------------------------------------------
"2) find questions & tasks"
"what can you ask about the challenge? what do users want to do with data? think high and low level. revisit this worksheet to break these down further."
"box #3 may help you revisit this box later"

Users need to access information about biological entities and the relations between them.
This information gives relevant context for experimental design and interpretation of experimental results.
This information is especially important for interpretation of large-scale data sets that cover the metabolic system broadly.

--------------------------------------------------
"3) check with users or explore data"
"users: what did you find out? what sparked curiosity?
data: characterize aspects of the data. what is it like?"
"get the real data and talk to real users if possible!"

Users need to know how multiple entities in the metabolic system (such as those for which experimental data are available) relate to each other.
Many of these relations transcend or traverse common or traditional pathways.
There are many dimensions, levels, or layers of relations in the metabolic system.
At the most basic level, users need to know how multiple metabolites relate to each other through chemical reactions.
These reactions are a single dimension of the metabolic system.
Types of entities other than metabolites also participate in this dimension of the metabolic system.
Users need to know the proteins that either catalyze reactions or transport metabolites between cellular compartments.
Users need to know the transcripts and genes that encode these proteins.

Users also need to know about properties that might be relevant to relations between entities.
Maybe multiple entities share a property.
These properties might inform biological interpretation.

Data about the metabolic system describe properties of and relations between genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites.
Experimental data describe modifications to genes, transcripts or proteins.
Experimental data also describe the abundances of transcripts, proteins, or metabolites.

In the most common use scenario, the user needs to interpret data for a single type of entities, such as metabolites.
In a higher-level use scenario, the user needs to interpret data for two types of entities simultaneously, such as metabolites and transcripts.

--------------------------------------------------
"4) brainstorm design requirements"
"what are recurring trends? what are key design opportunities? are there constraints worth listing?"

The metabolic system is large and complex.
It is impractical, unreasonable, and useless for a human user to attempt to conceptualize the entire system simultaneously.
The user needs methods to select subsets of the metabolic system that are relevant to the user's interest (such as an experiment).
This selection process itself might involve many criteria and be complex.
Methods for this selection are excellent design opportunities.
Many possible factors could influence their effectiveness.

Even subsets of the metabolic system might be excessively complex.
The user needs methods to explore these subsets.
The user needs to recognize important information from the metabolic system easily.
The user needs a summary or overview to give context.
The user needs details on demand or details according to interest.
Methods for this exploration are excellent design opportunities.

Experimental data convey information about entities in the metabolic system.
Users need methods to recognize trends in these data that are dependent on aspects of the metabolic system.
Methods for this data communication are excellent design opportunities.

--------------------------------------------------
"5) compare and rank design requirements"
"choose a method for comparison: pros/cons table, rank based on your findings/user needs/tasks. cross out the list based on listed justifications, or pick top 3 to keep and why. explain and review with a group or partner."
"is this the right challenge to tackle? is there enough detail? or too much? too many or not enough requirements? complete this worksheet again to refocus the project."

Selection Tasks
----------
Note
Shortest path is a reasonable and important default selection parameter.
The selection process will always return a continuous subset of the network.
For that reason, it does not just return nodes that have some property.
It returns the nodes and nodes and links between them.
The user can subsequently select just the nodes that match the property and high-light them.
----------
-Select all nodes and links within a specific path length of one node or link.
--Example: Select all metabolites and reactions within 3 reactions of pyruvate.
-Select all nodes and links in the shortest path(s) between two nodes or links.
--Example: Select all metabolites and reactions in the shortest path(s) between glucose and pyruvate.
-Select all nodes and links in the shortest paths between multiple (more than two) nodes or links.
--Example: Select all metabolites and reactions in the shortest path(s) between (paths that connect) glucose, pyruvate, citrate, succinate, and glutamine.
-Determine the properties of nodes and links that are available in the data set.
--Example: Determine which cellular compartments are in the data set.
-Select all nodes and links within a specific path length of one node or link that also match some other property criteria.
--Example: Select all metabolites and reactions within 3 reactions of pyruvate that are also cytosolic.
-Select all nodes and links in the shortest path(s) between multiple nodes or links that also match some other property criteria.
--Example: Select all metabolites and reactions in the shortest path(s) between pyruvate and citrate that are also mitochondrial.
-Select all nodes and links in the shortest paths between all nodes or links that match some property criteria.
--Example: Select all metabolites and reactions in the shortest path(s) between all mitochondrial metabolites.

----------
Exploration Tasks
----------
Note
----------
-Represent the subset selection of the network visually.
--Represent in multiple ways?
-Represent some information about nodes and links on the network by default.
--Example: Display labels of names of metabolites on the network adjacent to nodes.
-Position nodes and links by network topology in a free layout, without layout restriction.
--Free layout will represent the topology and connectivity of the network.
-Determine the properties of nodes and links that are available in the data set.
-Position nodes and links with layout restriction according to property or properties.
--Example: Position nodes and links in a layout with regions, groups, or clusters according to subcellular compartment.
-Highlight on the network graph all nodes or links that have a specific property.
--Example: Highlight on the network graph all nodes for metabolites that locate in the mitochondrial compartment.
-Select nodes or links directly from the network graph.
-Display additional information for nodes or links upon selection or hover.
--Example: Display the names of proteins that catalyze reactions or mediate transport upon selection of links.
-Hide selected nodes or links from the network graph.
-Show nodes and links that connect directly to selected nodes or links on the network graph.

----------
Data Analysis Tasks
----------
Note
----------
-Represent experimental data corresponding to nodes or links on the network graph.
-Select specific sets or aspects of data to display.
--Example: Only display data for a specific experiment or measurement.
-Set visual encoding for data.
--Example: Set which color to use for a specific aspect of the data.
-Set threshold for which data to represent.
--Maybe this is not a good idea.
-Do not allow user to omit data for specific nodes or links.
--This functionality could support misrepresentation of the data or inappropriate omission of data.
