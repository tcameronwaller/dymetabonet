\section{Summary}

Metabolism is a vast and complex system with many types of relations between many types of biological entities.
With extensive connections throughout, it functions as a cooperative network.
To scientists, engineers, and clinicians who study metabolism, this complexity and continuity present a great challenge.
Investigators need to consider the holistic context of the network in order both to design experiments reliably and interpret experimental results accurately.
Current technologies for exploring metabolism primarily divide the network into distinct pathways and show these in static maps.
These tools fail to represent the continuity of the metabolic network as a whole.
They also fail to support exploration according to case-specific interest.
The goal of this project is to develop computational methods and a tool to enable users to explore the metabolic network.
In contrast to current technologies, this tool will support queries against the entire network to define custom selections.
This tool will represent these selections dynamically, offering alternative views to illustrate properties and attributes clearly.
