Peer Feedback Exercise

Peer: Paul J Shami, MD

Detail

Paul is a medical clinician with specialty in leukemia.
He also conducts laboratory research about leukemia.
The desktop on Paul's computer had very many icons.
I recognized that Paul was not very familiar with working with computers.
He was reasonably capable with graphical user interfaces (OSX Safari, Microsoft Excel).

In 2011 Paul or his team designed and performed an experiment.
He had 4 experimental groups: healthy white blood cells (from Paul himself), a laboratory leukemic cell line with micelle vector, the leukemic cell line with vector and drug A, and the leukemic cell line with vector and drug B.
He had 4-6 replicate samples for each experimental group.
Paul submitted these samples to the Metabolomics Core Facility at the University of Utah for processing and analysis by mass spectrometry.
I think the core facility processed Paul's samples and measured them by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry.
The core facility returned to Paul a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel with measurements of abundances for about 50 metabolites for all samples.
Paul analyzed the data by t-test to compare experimental groups.
Paul himself drew bar charts to represent the data for only 3 metabolites--glucose, lactate, and pyruvate.
Paul hardly considered the data any more from 2011 to today, 10 January 2017.

Paul knew that metabolism was a network, but he did not have much familiarity with or knowledge of this network.
I explained to Paul that the network gives context to analyze the data and to recognize trends.
Paul did not know about sources of information about the metabolic network.

Paul did not know about the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).
I showed Paul the KEGG database and showed him some examples of maps of portions of the metabolic network.
As I explained to Paul, I realized that the context of the metabolic network is indeed very complex.
I told Paul that the tools I was showing him were complex but that they were about the best that were available.
I think Paul understood and agreed.
I began to show Paul Escher, but I realized that it would be too difficult for Paul to know proper identifiers for metabolites from the metabolic models (Ex: pyr_c, cit_c).
It would be difficult and tedious for Paul to draw his own metabolic maps even with help from Escher.

Paul asked if there was a tool to recognize biological trends in the data.
He wanted to load his data into the tool.
Then he wanted the tool to identify trends in the data for him.
I told Paul about MetaboAnalyst, but I quickly realized that MetaboAnalyst was far too complex for Paul to use reliably.
It would be too easy for Paul to change an option that might compromise the validity of the result.

I looked over Paul's data and identified some potentially-interesting trends.
If I remember correctly, samples with a drug had an accumulation of citrate but a depletion of succinate, fumarate, and malate.
I explained why that trend was interesting in the context of the citrate cycle.
I mentioned that aconitase, and enzyme in the citrate cycle between citrate and succinate, has an iron-sulfur cluster.
Oxidative stress in the cell might disrupt the function of aconitase, causing accumulation of citrate and depletion of succinate.
I also considered glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, and asparagine and discussed the observations with Paul.

I recommended for Paul to prepare charts to represent the means and standard errors for his data for each metabolite.
I recommended for Paul also to perform statistical tests.
I recommended for Paul to request further assistance in analysis from James E Cox of the Metabolomics Core Facility.
I also recommended for Paul to discuss his results more with me and with Jared P Rutter.

Detail

The tool needs to be usable for a non-specialist.

A query-explorable network interface is a necessary part of the basic, useful tool.

Incorporate layers of complexity, simple to sophisticated.

Use data from metabolic models (systems biology).
These models are freely available and might not even have any licenses.
Maybe also use data from WikiPathways.

Link to KEGG, but do not use data for license reasons.

Build a functional prototype early (6 months) and get lots of feedback from users.

Depending on the scale of the data for the metabolic model, it might be necessary to build a server back-end.
It will be inconvenient to require the user to download a large quantity of data.
The problem with a server is that it would require maintenance in order not to become a security vulnerability.

What is the scale of the potential user base for this project?
What is the user base of KEGG or the RECON 2 metabolic model?

Clarify that metabolic flux simulations are beyond the scope of this project.

Integration of data from multiple 'omics technologies is important functionality and is of high interest currently in the scientific community.

For clarity, provide example of use case with experimental data.

The goal of this project is to develop a computational method tool that is useful to real users.
This goal and scope of this project is not a good fit for a publication in a computer science journal.
This project is a better fit for a publication in a biological methods journal or a bioinformatics journal.
That way the publication will be to the audience of prospective users.

If we wanted to pursue a computer science project, Alex recommended some ideas.
Comparative network visualization (differences in flux or due to other modification)
Visualization of multiple attributes for each node in context of the network

Data scale is a challenge in this project, since some selections of the metabolic network might be larger than the citrate cycle example.

Conduct survey or review of literature on current technology or related work.
Consider current publications of similar projects as templates and examples.

Consider publishing the methods or techniques of the project.
Also consider publishing a demonstration of the tool on biologically relevant data (either new or public).

Detail

Jared P Rutter discussed this project with Christian M Metallo on 15 or 16 December 2016.
Christian was enthusiastic and supportive about the project.

Christian is knows Bernhard O Palsson and a postdoctoral investigator on his team.
Christian is familiar with the Escher project from Palsson's team.
Christian recommended Escher as a very useful tool and mentioned that teams in industry use it.

I acknowledged the utility of Escher for drawing metabolic maps from metabolic models for systems biology.
I also explained the potential in exploring the metabolic network through queries.
I explained the necessity for automatic, dynamic layouts to represent selections of the metabolic network from these queries.

Christian is familiar with the need for tools to facilitate the study of metabolism.
He is aware that more investigators without particular expertise in metabolism are beginning to study it.
He is also aware that there is a risk for incorrect and unreliable conclusions from incorrect design of experiments or unreliable interpretation of results.

Christian acknowledged that some computational simulation in the study of metabolism (such as flux balance analysis) lacks a lot of experimental, empirical data to support it.
He realizes that there is a real limitation to these sorts of simulations.
He also recognizes that these simulations can be useful for hypothesis formation.
Christian and his team do more metabolic flux analysis that has more support from experimental results (isotopic tracer analysis).

Christian is interested in the potential of using ratios in the abundances of metabolites (citrate/2-oxoglutarate, succinate/fumarate) as indicators for metabolic profiling.
Some metabolites are present in the cell at very consistent ratios between each other.
Diseases disrupt these ratios.
Rather than just consider the abundances of the metabolites, considering the ratios might be more robust and informative.

Detail

As I introduced the project, I described the target users as investigators in the domains of biology, biotechnology, pharmacology, and medicine who study metabolism.
Jared emphasized his opinion that the primary users would be investigators who do not have expertise or specialty in metabolism, but who perform experiments to study metabolism.
There is an increasing prevalence of non-experts who study metabolism, and tools can especially assist these investigators.
The team seemed to focus a lot on how the tool could benefit novices (non-experts in studying metabolism).
Some members of the team even leaned to the extreme of considering the tool for educational purposes.
Specific candidate users who study metabolism without being experts are Trudy Oliver, Stephen McKellar, and Paul Shami.

Especially for novice users, the team emphasized the importance of keeping the tool simple.
Too much complexity in the tool will overwhelm novice users and discourage them from using the tool.
It might be useful to have more sophisticated options and features (such as enabling the user to select which metabolite nodes to replicate), but these features should be optional to avoid overwhelming users.

Someone recommended the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) visualization of genetic interactions as an interesting model for an interface.

Someone recommended considering cell and tissue types.
That level of complexity might be beyond the scope of this project.

Queries that involve properties or attributes depend on the factors that are available in the metabolic model.
It will be very important to provide users with a clear representation of the properties that are options for use in the query.
Maybe it would be helpful to compile a list of candidate properties.
For each property, give information about it.
If the property is quantitative (like degree or rate), give its range.
If the property is categorical, give a list of its categories.
Make all of these properties very clear and accessible to the user.
Pop-down menus would be a reasonable way to show options to the user.

The metabolic community is currently interested in metabolic processes/paths that involve reactions between different cellular compartments.
It might be helpful to facilitate queries for this sort of pathway.

There was concern about potential problems in specifying compartments in queries against the network.
Experimental data such as metabolomics do not discern between metabolites in different compartments.
For example, if the user only considers synthesis of a metabolite in one compartment then she/he might neglect synthesis in another compartment and hence mis-interpret experimental results.
People recommended altering the user to situations where ignoring a compartment could be deceptive.

Maybe consider flux rates in ranking query results.

Making flux simulations accessible for analyzing data in the context of the network could be very powerful and useful.

It could be useful to compare the user's experimental data to reference data for profiles.
For example, compare the user's data to data characteristic (profile) of diabetes.
Either compare to common reference profiles or allow the user to define her/his own references.

Allow the user to query the network by experimental data set.
Maybe include some sort of significance threshold.
I sort of think that functionality might be beyond scope.
Let the user analyze the data in some other tool.
That might avoid errors in analysis.

Requiring the user to select metabolite nodes for replication is too complex.
The program should choose nodes for replication by default.
The program should somehow indicate to the user which nodes it replicated.
The program should provide the user the option of changing this replication.
The program should also give users the option to omit nodes from the network representation.
In the metabolite degree table, consider grouping metabolites by category (cofactors, etc).

There should be a glossary for technical terms like "topology" and "degree".

Make the tool very user-friendly and simple by default.
Include more sophisticated options for advanced users.

Maybe build the program to accommodate plugins.
That way the user could customize her/his own version of the program according to her/his desired functionality.

Maybe have novice and expert versions of the program.

Have minimal options on the initial screen.

Support simple and advanced searches, maybe.

Consider including some information about general experimental design and reliable data inputs.

The team understood and acknowledged the benefits of integrating with metabolic models from the systems biology community.
These models are highly developed and robust.
The community develops and maintains the models, so I will not need to curate.

Peers: Alexander Lex, Sean P McKenna

----------
Detail

Alexander Lex and Sean P McKenna are experts in information visualization

I showed to Alex and Sean sketch 2016-11-11_1 and 2016-11-15_1.

----------
1) Critique
I want to show more information about metabolites or reactions when the user interacts with corresponding elements in the Exploration View.
Alex and Sean recommend that there is too much information to display in a pop-up tool tip.
This tool tip would be large and would occlude other parts of the node-link graph.
It would be better to display this information in a separate view.

1) Response
I agree with Alex and Sean.
We actually discussed this design decision in a previous meeting.
I brought it up in this meeting, so I mentioned it here.

----------
2) Critique
As I depicted in sketch 2016-11-11_1, my idea was to display information about metabolites and reactions in an information panel that pops up within the Exploration View.
Alex and Sean recommend that I move this information panel out of the Exploration View and make it its own view below the Navigation View on the left.
In order to make more room for this additional view, Alex and Sean recommend that I reduce the dimensions of the Query View.
For the prototype for the Data Visualization Course, the query interface will only cinsiste of a drop-down menu enabling the user to select a model.
The interface does not need to be large.

2) Response
I agree and plan to implement the change.

----------
3) Critique
Alex and Sean recommend that the table giving information on metabolite degrees should be sortable.

3) Response
I agree and already represented this design idea in sketch 2016-11-15_1.

----------
4) Critique
Alex and Sean recommend that it would be nice to link the degree table with the node-link graph in both directions.
If the user hovers over a metabolite's row in the degree table, the corresponding metabolite nodes in the node-link graph should have highlight.
Conversely, if the user hovers over a metabolite's node in the node-link graph, the corresponding metabolite's row in the degree table should have highlight.
In the case that the degree table does not all fit on the screen (and so has a scroll bar), it would be nice if hovering over a metabolite's node also scrolled to the corresponding metabolite's row in the degree table.

4) Response
I agree that this interactive linkage between the degree table and the node-link graph is important.
In my opinion, it is most important for user interaction with the degree table to show highlight on the node-link graph.
In my opinion, that direction of linkage is the greater priority and I should implement it first.

----------
5) Critique
Alex and Sean recommend that it would be nice to drag to reposition the edges that correspond to reactions in the node-link graph.

5) Response
The representation for reactions in the node-link graph consists of two nodes (an in node and an out node) along with an edge between these nodes.
In my opinion, that abstraction is beneficial because the reactions edge positions and orients according to the rest of the graph.
Also, edges from reactant metabolites converge at the "in" end of the reaction link while edges from product metabolites converge at the "out" end of the reaction link.
If I use a force-directed layout, in my opinion my current abstraction or representation of reactions is best.
To allow the user to drag and reposition reaction edges, I could make reactions' in and out nodes larger to serve as handles.

----------
6) Critique
Alex and Sean observed that the force-directed layout of nodes and links in a graph for anything other than a very simple pathway did not work well.
The layout was complex and had many overlaps.
Alex and Sean recommended that I try to optimize the layout.
Alex also recommended that layout optimization is a lesser priority at this stage of the project.
Alex recommended that enabling the user to replicate nodes might help to improve the layout and simplify the graph.
Alex also recommended enabling the user to anchor nodes on demand.

6) Response
Perhaps I can optimize the force-directed layout by changing force parameters.
Perhaps I can enable the user to anchor or free nodes by double-click.

----------
7) Critique
Alex recommended that the user should be able to select nodes for replication either from the degree table or from the node-link graph.

7) Response
I agree.

----------
8) Critique
Alex recommended that I should minimize the amount of screen space that I devote to the project title.

8) Response
Perhaps I could display a minimal logo and project name in the top-left corner of the screen.
Maybe I could display the project subtitle or additional information when the user hovers over the icon.
That is a very low priority.

----------
9) Critique
Sean recommended that I consider ways to include appropriate legends to clarify abstractions/representations in the node-link diagram and elsewhere in the interface.

9) Response
I agree that all abstractions/representations should be clear to the user.
Currently I do not think that legends are very necessary or a high priority.
I will consider the necessity and value of legends as I develop the interface more.

----------
1) Critique
Alex and Sean recommend that I distinguish between the short-term trial project for the Data Visualization Course and the long-term research project for publication.
The scopes of the projects are very different.
I need to narrow the scope of the short-term trial project for the sake of feasibility.

1) Response
There are many features that I envision for the long-term project that I will need to omit from the short-term project.

----------
2) Critique
Alex and Sean both considered my plan for the project to be far too broad and general.
They emphasized the need for specific use tasks and requirements.

2) Response
It is accurate that my plan for the project up to this point is very general and broad.
I need to consider specific requirements for the project and propose specific solutions to meet those.
As I consider requirements and solutions, I need to consider the scope of the project to ensure feasibility.

----------
3) Critique
Alex considered it unnecessary to disregard pathway annotation in the metabolic network.
He considered pathway annotation to be an informative semantic feature of the data.
He did not consider this annotation to be arbitrary.

3) Response
I agree that pathway annotation (Glycolysis, Pentose Phosphate, Citrate Cycle) is informative.
Pathways are a useful way to recognize portions of the metabolic network.
I do intend for the user to be able to explore the network by pre-defined pathways (assuming that the models of the metabolic network include this annotation).
I also want to enable the user to query the network in a way that is independent of pre-defined pathways.
I intend for the user to be able to query the network on the basis of topology, not just annotation.
The user will be able to query for paths connecting nodes even if these paths cross multiple pre-defined pathways.

----------
4) Critique
Alex asked me about my previous idea to include flux rates as properties of the network.
There are mixed, conflicting opinions in the biological community about the utility of reaction rates in metabolic models since many of these rates are predictions.
Alex considers this information to be an interesting aspect of the network.
Alex also considers that since the community is divided, it may be helpful to support visual evaluation of this rate information.

4) Response
I agree with Alex.
I lean towards acknowledging the utility of the rate information.
I think that rate should be an aspect of the long-term project.

----------
5) Critique
In the interest of feasibility in the scope of this project (for the data visualization course), both Alex and Sean recommend that I focus on the visual representation of the network information.
They recommend that I omit query interface from this short-term trial project.

5) Response
I agree.

Detail

Jared P Rutter is an expert in biology and metabolism.

----------
1) Critique
I showed Jared my sketch 2016-10-31_1 (Date: 31 October 2016, Number: 1) to illustrate the concept that the metabolic network is actually a combination of networks in multiple dimensions for different types of entities and relations between them.
I showed Jared my sketch 2016-10-31_2 (Date: 31 October 2016, Number: 2) to illustrate the concept that it would be possible to organize nodes spatially by properties such as sub-cellular compartment.
I showed Jared my sketch 2016-10-31_3 (Date: 31 October 2016, Number: 3) to illustrate the concept that it would be possible to represent the metabolic network on a grid between two or more node types.
Jared did not like this visual representation of the metabolic network.
I showed Jared my sketch 2016-10-20_1 (Date: 20 October 2016, Number: 1) to illustrate the concept that it would be possible to represent the metabolic network as a node-link diagram with multiple types of nodes and multiple types of links.
Jared preferred this node-link diagram representation of the network, and he also thought that it would be beneficial to simplify the network by only representing relevant nodes and types of nodes.
I also showed Jared an example of the interface of the KEGG Pathways database.
This interface involves static maps of pre-define pathways.
Jared drew sketch 2016-11-01_1 (Date: 1 November 2016, Number: 1) to illustrate his idea for a minimally-functional and useful tool.
His idea for a functional tool most importantly considers the network of direct relations of reactions between metabolites, the direct metabolic network.
The user is able to select a subset of this network using a set of metabolites for which she or he has data, for example.
The tool draws a custom, dynamic map of the network connecting these entities of interest.
The map is a node-link diagram.
This map primarily represents nodes for entities of the metabolite type and links for relations of the reaction type.
The map is interactive allowing the user to navigate and explore the map and customize it further.
Also, the user can highlight nodes in the query set on the network.
Also, the user can highlight or position nodes in the network by properties (compartment, cofactor).
The user can then observe some indication for accumulation or depletion of metabolites on the network map to give context to the data.
The user can map a representation of experimental data onto the network map.
Color value of nodes or glyphs next to nodes would most likely encode the experimental data for each node.
Jared was not sure if it would be better to show a quantitative color scale for degree of accumulation (red) or degree of depletion (blue) or to just use two colors for binary (yes or no) accumulation or depletion.
The issue is how informative fold change really is anyway.
In other terms, the color could represent fold change (bidirectional), direction of change (up or down), or p-value associated with change (accumulation or depletion determines color--red or blue--, p-value determines color value).
Jared emphasized the importance to start small with a feasible scope and think big, allowing for extensibility.
The most common usage scenario will probably involve a single data set for a single node type.
For example, accomodate a data set for metabolomics (most important), transcriptomics (next priority), or proteomics.
Accomodating data sets for multiple node types (metabolomics and transcriptomics) is an additional feature.
Also, the network of reactions between metabolites is most important.
It will also be useful to include information about enzymes (for proteomics), their transcripts (for transcriptomics), and their genes.
Also, it will simplify to filter out properties that do not matter as much.
In Jared's opinion, reaction rates are unreliable predictions anyway.
Jared does acknowledge the value of properties such as subcellular compartment and protein cofactors.

1) Response
Jared's idea for the tool is an improvement on current tools such as KEGG Pathways.
The users ability to define a custom subset of the network by a query against the comprehensive database is a very important and useful feature.
The user could query by a set of metabolites (most important), proteins, or transcripts.
A major limitation of current technology is the necessity to view parts of the metabolic network in sets of pre-defined, somewhat arbitrary pathways.
Really all metabolic pathways are connected, so a custom subset of the network is most relevant.

Detail

Sean P McKenna is an expert in information visualization.

----------
1) Critique
Sean emphasized the importance of matching visual encodings with the priority level of the information.
It is beneficial to use the best visual channel to represent the most important information.
Position is the best visual channel.
Sean thought that the node-link diagram did not use position for the most important information.
Sean also thought that the node-link diagram would not scale well to a large set of data.
Sean also thought that a parallel-coordinates chart did not represent the network information well.
Sean recommended using position to represent the network.
Sean recommended using a representation similar to an adjacency matrix or a grid.
Sean specifically referred me to the RelEx project by Michael Sedlmair.

1) Response
A grid-like representation of the network has a lot of potential.
This representation scales well and supports spatial/positional grouping well.
One axis could have metabolites, and the other axis could have proteins that interact with those metabolites.
It might be beneficial to group entities on either axis by subcellular compartment, experimental data, or any other property.
This representation would show groups well.
Maybe it would be good to represent the network using both node-link diagrams and grids.
The grid can only represent so many types of information at a time.
The user will need to specify the node types for each axis.
The user will need to specify which property to use for grouping nodes on each axis.
Maybe the program could somehow suggest grouping strategies based on experimental data.

Summary

1) Critique
Use simplification of network data for visual design project.
1) Response
Use a representative (variety of node types, node properties, and relation types) subset of network data.
Use simulation data.

2) Critique
Multiple levels of user interaction in query may be too complex.
2) Response
Distinguish subset selection query from exploration processes.
Provide sufficient support for dynamic and specific queries.
Provide functionality to narrow selection further for the sake of exploration.

3) Critique
The node-link diagram is complex and does not scale well with the data.
The parallel-coordinates chart might scale better while representing trends well.
3) Response
While it has major limitations, a node-link diagram is one of the best ways to represent the metabolic network visually.
Alternative visual representations, including parallel-coordinates chart, might be useful in supplementary views, especially to represent experimental data in context.

4) Critique
It would be helpful to represent some sort of holistic overview of the entire network to orient the user and provide context.
4) Response
The scale and complexity of the metabolic network essentially rules out a comprehensive overview.
Maybe a good query interface will provide sufficient access to the comprehensive system.
It would still be beneficial to have some sort of representation of overview context.

----------
----------

Detail

----------
1) Critique
The metabolic system is a network of multiple types of nodes, multiple types of links between them, and tens of thousands of instances of all of these.
Asmaa recognized the overwhelming complexity of this network and recommended that I use a much-simplified subset of this network data for my concept-based project.

1) Response
Asmaa's advice to simplify the data for the sake of a concept-exploratory project is wise.
I will need to select a representative subset of the network.
I could also consider using simulation data or artificial data for the sake of the concept.

----------
2) Critique
In my current design, the user queries the biological network for paths that connect specific nodes or subsets of the network that otherwise satisfy specific criteria.
The user then selects a subset of the network from a list of ranked results.
The user then refines this subset according to her or his interest.
This refinement process involves selecting types or instances of nodes and links to include or remove from the subset.
Asmaa observed that these subsequent refinements will drastically alter the relevance of the original search results.
For example, the only thing connecting two branches of a subset of the network is a gene.
If the user subsequently decides not to include gene-related links in the network, then that entire branch will be lost.
The main issue is that subsequent modifications will render the search results obsolete and irrelevant.
Asmaa thought that this use of multiple levels of user interaction to define subsets of interest (separation of initial query from more-specific refinements) will not work well.

2) Response
Asmaa's observation is accurate and very relevant.

It is important for the user to obtain an objective and accurate selection of a subset of the network.
For that reason, the query process matters.
It seems detrimental to nullify this query process.

The difficulty and source of this problem relates to the complexity of the biological network.
This network has multiple types of nodes and multiple types of links.
For this reason, querying this network is more complex than querying a social authorship network as in PathFinder.

It is important to consider the goal of the subset selection process.
The problem is that the biological network is too vast and complex to really consider or understand comprehensively.
The solution is to use a computational system to store information about the comprehensive biological network and then enable the human user to select and access subsets according to her or his interest.

It think it is important for this selection process to be objective and free of bias so that the user does not over-emphasize some aspects and neglect others inappropriately.
When I think about it more, however, I am not sure if any selection process will be entirely free of bias.
Any specific query criteria will exclude aspects of the network.
That will be true even if the criteria are to select the most direct paths rather than extremely round-about ones.
To solve this problem, I think the interface should balance computational objectivity with human intuition.

Maybe the solution is to use an holistic selection process.
Do not try to separate the selection process into multiple steps.
Use a dynamic query interface so that the user can narrow a selection progressively.
The idea is to say "show me all of the nodes and links in the network that match these criteria".
Keep all of these criteria together for the sake of transparency and to preserve the record of what the user did.

Alright, so that is the selection process.
Another, related process is visualization and exploration of the selection or subset of the network.
Even with a very specific (and exclusive) selection process, I think it will be necessary for the user to interactively narrow and change the aspects of the network that show up at any point. For example, at this point the user can select which types of nodes and links to display in a given view at a given time.

Maybe it should not be possible for the user to exclude specific types of nodes or links from the query selection subset.
It probably should be possible for the user to decide how or if to display these.

----------
3) Critique
In my current design, a node-link diagram with dynamic layout is the primary visual representation of the metabolic network.
I also considered alternative representations of the network.
My favorite alternative visual representation of the network is a parallel coordinates chart.
Asmaa did not much like the node-link diagram as a visual representation of the metabolic network.
I think she considered the network to be too complex for the node-link diagram to represent it well.
In contrast, Asmaa thought that the parallel coordinates chart had a lot of potential to represent aspects of the network.

3) Response
I like the idea of considering alternative methods of representing the metabolic network visually.
The parallel coordinates chart is my favorite alternative visual representation that I have considered.
I have not figured out all the details, but my idea is to somehow rank or order each type of entity on a separate axis and then draw lines to represent relations between different entity types.
The ranking could be based on degree of connectivity or on experimental data.

The parallel coordinates chart would handle scale and complexity well and represent it clearly.
Trends would be clear.
The parallel coordinates chart would, in some ways, handle scale and complexity better than the node-link diagram.

A challenge of the parallel coordinates representation is that the chart would have to be different for different types of relations.
For example, code relations are only between genes, transcripts, and proteins, not metabolites.
Also, often there are relations between entities of the same type.
For example, multiple proteins interact with each other.

I think that a node-link diagram is one of the best ways to represent the metabolic network visually.
It definitely has limitations also.
A major challenge is how to represent multiple different types of nodes and links simultaneously.
Representing multiple types of links is especially problematic.

Asmaa wanted some sort of overview of the entire network for the sake of context.

4) Response
I agree that it would be helpful to have some sort of overview or means to give a sense of context.
The scale and complexity of the metabolic network is such that I doubt that a truly-complete representation would be an effective overview.
For example, it would be difficult even to highlight the subset on this complete overview in an understandable way.
Maybe there are other methods to establish some sense of context.
I need to consider ideas more.
Maybe a good query interface will be enough to provide access to the comprehensive system.
