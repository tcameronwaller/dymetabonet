Note:
Carolina Nobre and Sean P McKenna helped to inspire the ideas of this sketch.
In this sketch I illustrated the idea of representing reactions as super edges (special nodes really) between reactant metabolites and product metabolites.
It will be important for links from reactant and product metabolites to converge at opposite ends of the reaction's super edge.
For that purpose, the reaction super edge will actually need to consist of two nodes.
Then I will draw some sort of mark (preferably a shape that indicates direction) between the two reaction nodes.

Carolina Nobre and Sean P McKenna helped to inspire the ideas of this sketch.
In this sketch I illustrated two options for representations of the metabolic network.
These options are at opposite extremes of the spectrum balancing accuracy with simplicity/clarity.
The first representation shows the network without replication of any nodes.
Reactant and product metabolites have links that converge on a super link that represents a single reaction.
The second representation shows the network as single, distinct reactions between super nodes of reactant and product metabolites.
To the extent that it is reasonably interpretable and not too complex, I prefer the first option since it represents the metabolic network most accurately.
Sketch 2016-11-08_3 represents the network in an intermediate strategy between these two extremes that has a good chance of being the best option.

Note:
Carolina Nobre and Sean P McKenna helped to inspire the ideas of this sketch.
I illustrated the idea that a single metabolite can participate in multiple reactions in a single pathway and can also participate in multiple pathways.
It is accurate to represent a single metabolite as a single node in the network in order to represent its connections accurately.
These multiple levels of participation also make the metabolic network complex and might make the node-link diagram excessively complex with inter-connectivity.
To simplify the network, an option is to replicate highly-connected nodes in order to simplify the network representation.
In order to do that, there is a need for algorithms to decide which nodes to replicate and which to preserve in their true context in the network.
In representing the metabolic network there needs to be a balance between accuracy and simplicity/clarity.
Maybe determine the degree of every node in the network model.
Allow the user to select a range for the degrees of metabolites to replicate in order to simplify the representation of the network.
For example, while the original network might have a single entry for h_c (cytosolic hydrogen), the user could specify to replicate nodes with degrees greater than 10 in the network.
Then the program could replicate h_c for each reaction in which it participates (id: h_c_1, h_c_2, h_c3, etc).
I think that process should probably happen specifically for the subset of the network that the user selects in the query.

Note:
I realized that many (probably the majority) of metabolic reactions involve additional reactants that enter the pathway at intermediate reactions.
That means that the super node of product metabolites from a reaction is not the same as the super node of reactant metabolites for the next reaction in the pathway.
I realized that the super node strategy was likely to represent the majority of reactions as single reactions that did not connect in pathways or a meaningful network.
This visual representation of the metabolite network would be relatively useless.

Note:
In a meeting with Alexander Lex, Carolina Nobre, and Asmaa AlJuahni, I described the problem of defining links between multiple reactant metabolites and multiple product metabolites in a reaction.
Alexander Lex and Carolina Nobre recommended that I use super nodes to represent all metabolites that participate in a reaction as either reactants or products.
By that strategy it would be possible to draw a single link for each reaction.
In a meeting with Alexander Lex and Sean P McKenna, we also discussed goal features for the prototype of the project for 11 November 2016.
I drew this sketch to represent the idea of super nodes and to illustrate some of the goal features.

Note:
Each reaction involves multiple reactant metabolites and multiple product metabolites.
Each of these metabolites is a node.
It would not be reasonable to treat all reactant metabolites as a super-node because that would artificially inflate the number of nodes in the network.
Each of these metabolites has links to all other metabolites in the reaction.
To simplify, ignore links between all reactants and all products.
Since there are multiple links for a single reaction, it would be nice to simplify this structure visually.
1) Distinct Links draws links as straight lines between each reactant and all products.
2) Link Bundle draws links but bundles links from the same reaction together to simplify the network structure visually.
Link Bundle would be more complex when each metabolite participates in multiple reactions.
3) Super Link draws links between each reactant and product to a central super link line representing the reaction.
Super Link is my favorite option, but it would also be more complex when each metabolite participates in multiple reactions.

In this sketch I explored several strategies for representation of different types of links between nodes.
