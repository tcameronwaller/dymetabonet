# DyMetaNet

## Why the silly name?
## The project needed a title, and it stands for "Dynamic Metabolic Networks".

Networks, or graphs, are abstract representations of relations between entities.
Metabolic networks represent chemical reactions between molecular metabolites
within cells.
It's possible to define these networks in different ways, with prominent
differences.
DyMetaNet illustrates these differences by dynamically defining and visualizing
networks from human metabolism.
