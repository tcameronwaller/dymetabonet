# DyMetaboNet
## "Dynamic Metabolic Networks"

Networks, or graphs, are abstract representations of relations between
entities.
Metabolic networks represent chemical reactions between molecular metabolites
within cells.
It is possible to define these networks in different ways, with prominent
differences.
DyMetaboNet illustrates these differences by dynamically defining and
visualizing networks from human metabolism.
