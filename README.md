# [DyMetaboNet][1]

Networks, or graphs, are abstract representations of relations between
entities. Metabolic networks represent chemical reactions between molecular
metabolites within cells. It is possible to define these networks in different
ways, with prominent differences.

DyMetaboNet illustrates these differences by dynamic definition and
visualization of human metabolic networks.

DyMetaboNet is a partner of [MetaboNet][2].
