Detail

Jared P Rutter is an expert in biology and metabolism.

1) Critique
I showed Jared my sketch 2016-10-31_1 (Date: 31 October 2016, Number: 1) to illustrate the concept that the metabolic network is actually a combination of networks in multiple dimensions for different types of entities and relations between them.
I showed Jared my sketch 2016-10-31_2 (Date: 31 October 2016, Number: 2) to illustrate the concept that it would be possible to organize nodes spatially by properties such as sub-cellular compartment.
I showed Jared my sketch 2016-10-31_3 (Date: 31 October 2016, Number: 3) to illustrate the concept that it would be possible to represent the metabolic network on a grid between two or more node types.
Jared did not like this visual representation of the metabolic network.
I showed Jared my sketch 2016-10-20_1 (Date: 20 October 2016, Number: 1) to illustrate the concept that it would be possible to represent the metabolic network as a node-link diagram with multiple types of nodes and multiple types of links.
Jared preferred this node-link diagram representation of the network, and he also thought that it would be beneficial to simplify the network by only representing relevant nodes and types of nodes.
I also showed Jared an example of the interface of the KEGG Pathways database.
This interface involves static maps of pre-define pathways.
Jared drew sketch 2016-11-01_1 (Date: 1 November 2016, Number: 1) to illustrate his idea for a minimally-functional and useful tool.
His idea for a functional tool most importantly considers the network of direct relations of reactions between metabolites, the direct metabolic network.
The user is able to select a subset of this network using a set of metabolites for which she or he has data, for example.
The tool draws a custom, dynamic map of the network connecting these entities of interest.
The map is a node-link diagram.
This map primarily represents nodes for entities of the metabolite type and links for relations of the reaction type.
The map is interactive allowing the user to navigate and explore the map and customize it further.
Also, the user can highlight nodes in the query set on the network.
Also, the user can highlight or position nodes in the network by properties (compartment, cofactor).
The user can then observe some indication for accumulation or depletion of metabolites on the network map to give context to the data.
The user can map a representation of experimental data onto the network map.
Color value of nodes or glyphs next to nodes would most likely encode the experimental data for each node.
Jared was not sure if it would be better to show a quantitative color scale for degree of accumulation (red) or degree of depletion (blue) or to just use two colors for binary (yes or no) accumulation or depletion.
The issue is how informative fold change really is anyway.
In other terms, the color could represent fold change (bidirectional), direction of change (up or down), or p-value associated with change (accumulation or depletion determines color--red or blue--, p-value determines color value).
Jared emphasized the importance to start small with a feasible scope and think big, allowing for extensibility.
The most common usage scenario will probably involve a single data set for a single node type.
For example, accomodate a data set for metabolomics (most important), transcriptomics (next priority), or proteomics.
Accomodating data sets for multiple node types (metabolomics and transcriptomics) is an additional feature.
Also, the network of reactions between metabolites is most important.
It will also be useful to include information about enzymes (for proteomics), their transcripts (for transcriptomics), and their genes.
Also, it will simplify to filter out properties that do not matter as much.
In Jared's opinion, reaction rates are unreliable predictions anyway.
Jared does acknowledge the value of properties such as subcellular compartment and protein cofactors.

1) Response
Jared's idea for the tool is an improvement on current tools such as KEGG Pathways.
The users ability to define a custom subset of the network by a query against the comprehensive database is a very important and useful feature.
The user could query by a set of metabolites (most important), proteins, or transcripts.
A major limitation of current technology is the necessity to view parts of the metabolic network in sets of pre-defined, somewhat arbitrary pathways.
Really all metabolic pathways are connected, so a custom subset of the network is most relevant.

Peer: Sean P McKenna

Detail

Sean P McKenna is an expert in information visualization.

----------
1) Critique
Sean emphasized the importance of matching visual encodings with the priority level of the information.
It is beneficial to use the best visual channel to represent the most important information.
Position is the best visual channel.
Sean thought that the node-link diagram did not use position for the most important information.
Sean also thought that the node-link diagram would not scale well to a large set of data.
Sean also thought that a parallel-coordinates chart did not represent the network information well.
Sean recommended using position to represent the network.
Sean recommended using a representation similar to an adjacency matrix or a grid.
Sean specifically referred me to the RelEx project by Michael Sedlmair.

1) Response
A grid-like representation of the network has a lot of potential.
This representation scales well and supports spatial/positional grouping well.
One axis could have metabolites, and the other axis could have proteins that interact with those metabolites.
It might be beneficial to group entities on either axis by subcellular compartment, experimental data, or any other property.
This representation would show groups well.
Maybe it would be good to represent the network using both node-link diagrams and grids.
The grid can only represent so many types of information at a time.
The user will need to specify the node types for each axis.
The user will need to specify which property to use for grouping nodes on each axis.
Maybe the program could somehow suggest grouping strategies based on experimental data.

Summary

1) Critique
Use simplification of network data for visual design project.
1) Response
Use a representative (variety of node types, node properties, and relation types) subset of network data.
Use simulation data.

2) Critique
Multiple levels of user interaction in query may be too complex.
2) Response
Distinguish subset selection query from exploration processes.
Provide sufficient support for dynamic and specific queries.
Provide functionality to narrow selection further for the sake of exploration.

3) Critique
The node-link diagram is complex and does not scale well with the data.
The parallel-coordinates chart might scale better while representing trends well.
3) Response
While it has major limitations, a node-link diagram is one of the best ways to represent the metabolic network visually.
Alternative visual representations, including parallel-coordinates chart, might be useful in supplementary views, especially to represent experimental data in context.

4) Critique
It would be helpful to represent some sort of holistic overview of the entire network to orient the user and provide context.
4) Response
The scale and complexity of the metabolic network essentially rules out a comprehensive overview.
Maybe a good query interface will provide sufficient access to the comprehensive system.
It would still be beneficial to have some sort of representation of overview context.

Detail

----------
1) Critique
The metabolic system is a network of multiple types of nodes, multiple types of links between them, and tens of thousands of instances of all of these.
Asmaa recognized the overwhelming complexity of this network and recommended that I use a much-simplified subset of this network data for my concept-based project.

1) Response
Asmaa's advice to simplify the data for the sake of a concept-exploratory project is wise.
I will need to select a representative subset of the network.
I could also consider using simulation data or artificial data for the sake of the concept.

----------
2) Critique
In my current design, the user queries the biological network for paths that connect specific nodes or subsets of the network that otherwise satisfy specific criteria.
The user then selects a subset of the network from a list of ranked results.
The user then refines this subset according to her or his interest.
This refinement process involves selecting types or instances of nodes and links to include or remove from the subset.
Asmaa observed that these subsequent refinements will drastically alter the relevance of the original search results.
For example, the only thing connecting two branches of a subset of the network is a gene.
If the user subsequently decides not to include gene-related links in the network, then that entire branch will be lost.
The main issue is that subsequent modifications will render the search results obsolete and irrelevant.
Asmaa thought that this use of multiple levels of user interaction to define subsets of interest (separation of initial query from more-specific refinements) will not work well.

2) Response
Asmaa's observation is accurate and very relevant.

It is important for the user to obtain an objective and accurate selection of a subset of the network.
For that reason, the query process matters.
It seems detrimental to nullify this query process.

The difficulty and source of this problem relates to the complexity of the biological network.
This network has multiple types of nodes and multiple types of links.
For this reason, querying this network is more complex than querying a social authorship network as in PathFinder.

It is important to consider the goal of the subset selection process.
The problem is that the biological network is too vast and complex to really consider or understand comprehensively.
The solution is to use a computational system to store information about the comprehensive biological network and then enable the human user to select and access subsets according to her or his interest.

It think it is important for this selection process to be objective and free of bias so that the user does not over-emphasize some aspects and neglect others inappropriately.
When I think about it more, however, I am not sure if any selection process will be entirely free of bias.
Any specific query criteria will exclude aspects of the network.
That will be true even if the criteria are to select the most direct paths rather than extremely round-about ones.
To solve this problem, I think the interface should balance computational objectivity with human intuition.

Maybe the solution is to use an holistic selection process.
Do not try to separate the selection process into multiple steps.
Use a dynamic query interface so that the user can narrow a selection progressively.
The idea is to say "show me all of the nodes and links in the network that match these criteria".
Keep all of these criteria together for the sake of transparency and to preserve the record of what the user did.

Alright, so that is the selection process.
Another, related process is visualization and exploration of the selection or subset of the network.
Even with a very specific (and exclusive) selection process, I think it will be necessary for the user to interactively narrow and change the aspects of the network that show up at any point. For example, at this point the user can select which types of nodes and links to display in a given view at a given time.

Maybe it should not be possible for the user to exclude specific types of nodes or links from the query selection subset.
It probably should be possible for the user to decide how or if to display these.

----------
3) Critique
In my current design, a node-link diagram with dynamic layout is the primary visual representation of the metabolic network.
I also considered alternative representations of the network.
My favorite alternative visual representation of the network is a parallel coordinates chart.
Asmaa did not much like the node-link diagram as a visual representation of the metabolic network.
I think she considered the network to be too complex for the node-link diagram to represent it well.
In contrast, Asmaa thought that the parallel coordinates chart had a lot of potential to represent aspects of the network.

3) Response
I like the idea of considering alternative methods of representing the metabolic network visually.
The parallel coordinates chart is my favorite alternative visual representation that I have considered.
I have not figured out all the details, but my idea is to somehow rank or order each type of entity on a separate axis and then draw lines to represent relations between different entity types.
The ranking could be based on degree of connectivity or on experimental data.

The parallel coordinates chart would handle scale and complexity well and represent it clearly.
Trends would be clear.
The parallel coordinates chart would, in some ways, handle scale and complexity better than the node-link diagram.

A challenge of the parallel coordinates representation is that the chart would have to be different for different types of relations.
For example, code relations are only between genes, transcripts, and proteins, not metabolites.
Also, often there are relations between entities of the same type.
For example, multiple proteins interact with each other.

I think that a node-link diagram is one of the best ways to represent the metabolic network visually.
It definitely has limitations also.
A major challenge is how to represent multiple different types of nodes and links simultaneously.
Representing multiple types of links is especially problematic.

----------
4) Critique
Asmaa wanted some sort of overview of the entire network for the sake of context.

4) Response
I agree that it would be helpful to have some sort of overview or means to give a sense of context.
The scale and complexity of the metabolic network is such that I doubt that a truly-complete representation would be an effective overview.
For example, it would be difficult even to highlight the subset on this complete overview in an understandable way.
Maybe there are other methods to establish some sense of context.
I need to consider ideas more.
Maybe a good query interface will be enough to provide access to the comprehensive system.
