Main challenge is holistic context versus specific detail
Specific example of holistic context versus specific detail
The others (layout and vis exp results) more so explain the challenge
Dynamic layout is a solution, not a challenge
Group it with the first challenge
Experimental results visualization is also a sort of solution...


Query Interface
The distinction between criteria for inclusion and exclusion is confusing.

We need to discuss visual representation of the network more.
We also need to discuss visual representation of experimental data on the network more.

Importance and Relevance of Study of Metabolism

Metabolism sustains life.
Metabolic defects contribute to many human diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
The study of metabolism is relevant to domains of biology, biotechnology, pharmacology, and medicine.
Goals in these domains include understanding life, using life's mechanisms to synthesize materials and perform other tasks, modification of natural processes, diagnosis of human disease, and treatment of human disease.

Project Goal
Support the study of metabolism in domains of biology, biotechnology, pharmacology, and medicine.

Relevance, Goal

Metabolism as a System and Network

Metabolism is a system of biological entities and relations between them.
These entities include genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites.
These relations include ...

Metabolic Network
-Reactions (involving genes, transcripts, and proteins) relate metabolites.
--Simplification
--Focus on metabolic processes
--Model transport events as reactions.
-Diverse attributes and properties of nodes and links
--Attributes and properties define multiple sets (cellular compartment, metabolic pathway)
-"Digraph" with directional links
-"Hypergraph" with links between multiple nodes
-Great range (1-1000?) of "degree distribution" of degrees/connections of metabolite nodes.
-Prevalent loops.
-Many alternative paths.
--While some paths may dominate flux, alternative paths still matter.

Metabolism functions as a cooperative, inter-connected whole.

--------------------------------------------------
Study of Metabolism

1) Need to design experiments.
Experiments are to study functions of individual entities or processes.
Consider context of metabolic system when studying individual members.

2) Need to interpret experimental results.
Data include mutations and copy variations in genes (genomics), abundance and splice variations of transcripts (transcriptomics), abundance and post-translational modifications of proteins (proteomics), and abundance of metabolites (metabolomics).
Consider results in context of metabolic system.

Challenges in Study of Metabolism
1) Metabolism is a complex system.
Consideration for the entire system is necessary for both reliable design of experiments and accurate interpretation of results.
2) High-throughput methods, and data-heavy results, especially 'omics technologies.
3) More common for non-specialist, non-expert investigators to study metabolism.
Metabolism contributes to many human diseases and is relevant to many domains.

Study of metabolism
1) Design experiments.
Study functions of individual entities or processes.
2) Interpret results.
Especially interpret results from 'omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics).
In both of these cases, it is important to consider the holistic context of the metabolic system.

KEGG Atlas, Demonstration and Limitations

Slide
KEGG Atlas
Map "01100 Metabolic Pathways"
This map from KEGG Atlas represents the metabolic network between _____ metabolites.
The map only represents "most important" metabolites in reactions.
It organizes nodes for metabolites spatially by metabolic pathway or process.
There is no clear indication of compartmentalization.
This map-like layout is manually-drawn and is static.

Slide
KEGG
Map "01100 Metabolic Pathways"
Pyruvate Metabolism
Highlight all metabolites within 1 reaction of pyruvate.
Suppose we are interested in a subset of this metabolic network.
There is no support for custom queries (topology-based or otherwise).
I manually traced edges from the node for pyruvate to find all metabolites that relate directly (within 1 reaction).
Finding all 35 metabolites, copying their identifiers, and highlighting them on the map took me 1 hour.
Many sets of metabolites of interest (such as this set) are not all within the same pathway.
In many cases the relevant portion of the metabolic network traverses pathways.
Although all of these metabolites relate directly to pyruvate, their spatial positions depend on pathway.
The layout de-emphasizes and even distorts the connectivity between these metabolites.
The map replicates several nodes (including pyruvate's) in an ambiguous way.

Pyruvate Metabolism
Because KEGG uses static maps for "distinct" pathways, the user must find metabolites by searching multiple, separate maps.

--------------------------------------------------
Escher, Demonstration and Limitations

Show an Escher custom map of pyruvate metabolism.
Now explain compartmentalization.
These maps also do not account for compartmentalization.

Slide
Escher relates information from metabolic models (systems biology) to maps with manual, static layouts.

Slide

Slide
Escher relies on manual, static layouts for readability.
Escher is inappropriate for efficient exploration by custom queries.

--------------------------------------------------
Limitations in Current Technology

Spatial Groups in Layout
Free layouts represent topology (connectivity) of the network most accurately.
Free layouts can also suffer from excessive clutter and poor readability.
Layout restraints organize nodes into groups by position.
Depending on the user's interest, layout by compartment or by pathway/process can be helpful.
In many cases it is relevant to consider the compartments in which different reactions occur.
It can help to arrange reactions in positional groups to indicate compartment.
In other cases, compartmentalization is less relevant.

Technical Challenges in the Study of Metabolism

Challenges
1) Preserve holistic context while providing specific detail.
Metabolism functions as a cooperative whole.
Need to consider and study metabolism holistically.
Metabolism is also vast and complex.
Need to consider relevant portions of metabolism in detail according to interest.
2) Represent selections of the network flexibly and dynamically.
Connection and cooperation between members of the metabolic system traverse and transcend typical pathways.
Interest sets of metabolism are custom and case-specific with great variety.
There are many alternative paths.
3) Associate experimental results (data) with context of metabolic system.

Tasks

Maybe I should use "property" exclusively for attributes from the metabolic model and "attribute" exclusively for experimental data.

Selection Tasks
1) Select nodes and links by topology.
-Select by reactions, genes, transcripts, proteins, metabolites, or combinations thereof.
-Select by proximity, within specific path length (radius), to a node or nodes in the query.
-Select nodes and links in shortest paths connecting multiple nodes.
2) Select nodes and links by property (model factor) or attribute (experimental measurement).
-Select by inclusion or exclusion of any property or attribute of nodes or links.
3) Select nodes and links by both topology and property or attribute.
4) Build selection query from data of experimental results.
-Include all metabolites/transcripts/proteins in data set in the selection.

Exploration Tasks
1) Represent selections of the metabolic network visually.
-Nodes and links.
-Flexible, dynamic representation to accommodate custom selections.
2) Display network information (distribution of degree, betweenness centrality, and set distribution) for both entire model and selection.
3) Provide option to replicate nodes with high degrees.
4) Represent properties of nodes and links on the visual network.
-Arrange nodes and links in positional groups for sets (cellular compartment, pathway).
-Color nodes and links for sets (pathway).
5) On selection of nodes or links, display detail information for metabolites (common reaction partners, set distribution) or reactions (genes, transcripts, proteins).

Measurement Tasks
1) Represent selection of specific quantitative attribute by color saturation on the network.
-Either nodes for metabolites or links for genes, transcripts, or proteins.
