Demonstration

"Visual Exploration and Analysis of Metabolic Networks"
T Cameron Waller
10 October 2017

----------
Plan for Demonstration to Department of Biochemistry on 10 October 2017.

Metabolism includes all molecules and chemical reactions necessary to sustain life.
It operates as a cooperative system, in which it is difficult or impossible to study individual reactions in isolation.
A great challenge is to design experiments and interpret results with adequate context about the system.
This context includes properties about individual molecules and reactions as well as relations between them.
The goal of my project is to develop a tool for dynamic exploration of these properties and relationships within the metabolic system.

1. Source
-explain source of the data
--recon 2.2 model of human metabolism
---reactions: 7785
---metabolites (compartmental): 5324
---metabolites (general): 2652
--custom organization of the data
-load data from file

2. Entities' Sets
-explain attribution of entities to sets
--processes, compartments
-switch between cardinalities for metabolites and reactions
-show title with count of entities in a set, compartment "cytosol"

3. Filtration
-explain filtration of entities by their attributes
--processes, compartments
-select a single compartment, "cytosol"
-select filter in menu
--filtration menu only shows processes within the compartment
-select a single process, "Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis"
-select filter in menu
--filtration menu only shows compartments within the process
-explain navigation by exclusive sets
--process "Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis" occurs in compartments "cytosol", "mito matrix", "peroxisome" and "reticulum"
-select a single compartment, "mito matrix"
-explain filtration by combinations of attributes

4. Network
-explain definition of network's elements
--nodes and links
-define and represent network
--process: "Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis"
--compartment: "mito matrix"

5. Compartmentalization
-explain definition of network with or without compartmentalization
-assemble and represent networks for entities with or without compartmentalization
--process: "Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis"
--process: "Pyruvate metabolism"
-explain simplification by abstraction

5. Simplification
-explain simplification by abstraction
-show hubs in network
-explain simplification by replication of common metabolites

Note
-network definition and representation at 273 iterations for compartment "cytosol" requires 2.5 minutes.
-compartmental network definition and representation at 273 iterations for all entities requires 10-15 minutes.
