Title
"Visualization and Analysis of Sets and Entities in Metabolism"

--------------------------------------------------
Section: Goal, Tasks
--------------------------------------------------

----------
Slide

Goal
Understand properties and relationships in metabolism

Entities
Metabolites and reactions (genes, transcripts, proteins)

Sets of entities
Processes (pathways), and compartments (organelles)

Relations between entities and sets

The term "pathway" implies linearity.
I prefer the term "process" to represent cooperativity and nonlinearity.

Exploration, specific interest
In metabolism, there are many entities and sets with many properties.
It is important to give dynamic access to different aspects of information in sufficient detail.
Dynamic representations are themselves a challenge, especially in terms of layout of the network
There are many potential directions to take in support of the study of the metabolic network.

Describe specific tasks

----------
Slide

A and B are sets.
How does A compare to B (set cardinality, count of elements)?
Which compartment has more reactions, the cytosol or the mitochondrion?

Distinct metabolites or reactions

----------
Slide

A and B are sets.
How does A relate to B (set intersection, common elements)?
How many metabolites occur in both the mitochondrion and the peroxisome?

Distinct metabolites of interest

A is an entity.
Which entities relate to A?
Which reactions involve pyruvate?

Scale
Large counts of entities
Count of metabolites: ~10,000
Count of reactions: ~10,000
Visual representation of so many nodes is difficult to interpret

Slide

Connectivity
Relations between entities
Many-to-many
Plural relations between entities complicate visual representation

----------
Slide

Connectivity
Small-world
Common in biological networks (evolutionary pattern), social networks, and the internet's server networks
In small-world networks, a few metabolites, genes, transcripts, proteins, people, or servers are extremely influential
Hubs are central nodes

High degree of connectivity (density) around hubs in small-world networks complicates visual representation
Interpretation of topological traversal is also difficult

Remind about goals for proximity and paths

Section: Solution
--------------------------------------------------

----------
Slide

Abstraction
Summarize metabolism in sets of entities by attributes
Set cardinality (count of elements)
Selections of values of attributes define filters for entities

----------
Slide

Set intersection (common elements, relations)
Cartesian product for combinations of sets

----------
Slide

Definition of network
Metabolites with most reactions in metabolism are also the most common in the cell
Probably are not especially interesting

----------
Slide

Definition of network
Replication of nodes for common metabolites
Replication can simplify networks
Replication most appropriate for metabolites that are not of special interest

Definition of network
General metabolites versus compartmental metabolites
2652 general metabolites
5324 compartmental metabolites
Preference depends on interest
Relevance of compartmentalization and transport
