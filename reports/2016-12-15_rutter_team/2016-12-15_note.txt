Importance and Relevance of Study of Metabolism

Metabolism sustains life.
Metabolic defects contribute to many human diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
The study of metabolism is relevant to domains of biology, biotechnology, pharmacology, and medicine.
Goals in these domains include understanding life, using life's mechanisms to synthesize materials and perform other tasks, modification of natural processes, diagnosis of human disease, and treatment of human disease.

Project Goal
Support the study of metabolism in domains of biology, biotechnology, pharmacology, and medicine.

Relevance, Goal
Metabolism sustains life.
Metabolism is an integral part of the biological system.
Defects in metabolism drive many human diseases.
The goal of this project is to develop computational methods to support the study of metabolism in domains of biology, biotechnology, pharmacology, and medicine.

--------------------------------------------------
Study of Metabolism

1) Need to design experiments.
Consider context of metabolic system when studying individual members.

2) Need to interpret experimental results.
Consider results in context of metabolic system.
Data include mutations and copy variations in genes (genomics), abundance and splice variations of transcripts (transcriptomics), abundance and post-translational modifications of proteins (proteomics), and abundance of metabolites (metabolomics).

Slide 3
The study of metabolism
1) Design experiments to study functions of individual entities or processes.
2) Interpret results, especially from 'omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics).
In both of these cases, it is important to consider the holistic context of the metabolic system.

Challenges in the Study of Metabolism

Challenges
1) Preserve holistic context while providing specific detail.
Metabolism functions as a cooperative whole.
Need to consider and study metabolism holistically.
Metabolism is also vast and complex.
Need to consider relevant portions of metabolism in detail according to interest.
2) Represent selections of the network flexibly and dynamically.
Connection and cooperation between members of the metabolic system traverse and transcend typical pathways.
Interest sets of metabolism are custom and case-specific with great variety.
There are many alternative paths.
3) Associate experimental results (data) with context of metabolic system.

Tasks

Maybe I should use "property" exclusively for attributes from the metabolic model and "attribute" exclusively for experimental data.

Selection Tasks
1) Select nodes and links by topology.
-Select by proximity, within specific path length, to a single node.
-Select shortest paths connecting multiple nodes.
2) Select nodes and links by property (model factor) or attribute (experimental measurement).
-Select by inclusion or exclusion of any property or attribute of nodes or links.
3) Select nodes and links by both topology and property or attribute.

Exploration Tasks
1) Represent selections of the metabolic network visually.
-Nodes and links.
-Flexible, dynamic representation to accommodate custom selections.
2) Display network information (distribution of degree, betweenness centrality, and set distribution) for both entire model and selection.
3) Provide option to replicate nodes with high degrees.
4) Represent properties of nodes and links on the visual network.
-Arrange nodes and links in positional groups for sets (cellular compartment, pathway).
-Color nodes and links for sets (pathway).
5) On selection of nodes or links, display detail information for metabolites (common reaction partners, set distribution) or reactions (genes, transcripts, proteins).

Measurement Tasks
1) Represent selection of specific quantitative attribute by color saturation on the network.
-Either nodes for metabolites or links for genes, transcripts, or proteins.

Metabolism as a System and Network

Metabolism is a system of biological entities and relations between them.
These entities include genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites.
These relations include ...

Metabolic Network
-Reactions (involving genes, transcripts, and proteins) relate metabolites.
--Simplification
--Focus on metabolic processes
--Model transport events as reactions.
-Diverse attributes and properties of nodes and links
--Attributes and properties define multiple sets (cellular compartment, metabolic pathway)
-"Digraph" with directional links
-"Hypergraph" with links between multiple nodes
-Great range (1-1000?) of "degree distribution" of degrees/connections of metabolite nodes.
-Prevalent loops.
-Many alternative paths.
--While some paths may dominate flux, alternative paths still matter.

Metabolism functions as a cooperative, inter-connected whole.
