Slide 2

Note
Introduction of metabolism, metabolic regulation, and their study.
Metabolism is a collective system of all chemical reactions in an organism that are necessary for survival, growth, and reproduction.
Regulation within this system differentiates between many states of health and disease.
Metabolic diseases in humans include obesity, diabetes, cancer, and death.
Death involves complete disregulation of metabolism.
The study of metabolism is relevant to human health.
Metabolism's complexity is a challenge, especially as accurate context is important.

Slide 3

Note
Introduction of the metabolic network.
A network is an abstract representation of relations between entities.
Metabolism behaves like a network of reactions between metabolites.
Metabolites are small, biologically-relevant molecules.
Reactions involve roles of genes, transcripts, and proteins for encoding, catalysis, and regulation.
Metabolites and their reactions segregate between cellular compartments, organelles.
Sets of reactions behave cooperatively in pathways or processes.

Note
"So, this is a custom graph that I made with my application."
"It represents the entire network for the Recon 2.2 model of human metabolism."
"It has ___ nodes and ___ links."
"..."
"So, my job here is done."
"As you can see from this figure..."
"Believe it or not, graphs like this are not very useful."
