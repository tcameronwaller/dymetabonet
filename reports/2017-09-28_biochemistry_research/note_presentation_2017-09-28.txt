Slide 2

Note
Introduction of metabolism, metabolic regulation, and their study.
Metabolism is a collective system of all chemical reactions in an organism that are necessary for survival, growth, and reproduction.
The bodies of complex organisms like animals have distinct types of tissues with distinct types of cells that specialize in parts of metabolism.
An example of a metabolic reaction is the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase or glucokinase.
This reaction traps glucose within the cell and commits it to glycolysis or glycogen synthesis.
Glucokinase predominates in the liver and has a lesser affinity for glucose in order to regulate storage in states of abundance.
Regulation within metabolism differentiates between many states of health and disease.
Metabolic diseases in humans include obesity, diabetes, cancer, and death.
Death involves complete disregulation of metabolism.
The study of metabolism is relevant to human health.
Metabolism's complexity is a challenge, especially as accurate context is important.

Slide 3

Note
Introduction of the metabolic network.
A network is an abstract representation of relations between entities.
Nodes represent entities, and links represent relations.
It is a model for data.
Metabolism behaves like a network of reactions between metabolites.
Define different types of nodes for metabolites and reactions with links between them.
Nodes and links possess attributes or properties.
Metabolites are small, biologically-relevant molecules with attributes such as chemical formula and ionic charge.
Reactions involve roles of genes, transcripts, and proteins for encoding, catalysis, and regulation.
Reactions also have directionality and reversibility.
Metabolites and their reactions segregate between cellular compartments, organelles.
Sets of reactions behave cooperatively in pathways or processes.

----------
Slide 4

Note
Study of metabolic network at global, holistic scope
Due to the scale of the metabolic network, computational algorithms are necessary to study it at global scope.
Computational algorithms permit global analysis of the metabolic network and inform relevant observations.
Biological networks tend to be small-world and scale-free, with a few nodes as central hubs that minimize paths between many other nodes.
In a metabolic network, a hub might be a central metabolite such as pyruvate.
Modularity in metabolism involves compartments and pathways or processes that divide the system into smaller subsystems.
Connectivity in metabolism involves transports and cross-pathway reactions that connect all subsystems into a cooperative whole.
Metabolism behaves as a cooperative, continuous system that also demonstrates modular specialization.
Implications for evolution and regulation.

Slide 5

Note
Introduction of the metabolic model or reconstruction.
Metabolic models are compilations of information from genomic annotations, biochemical databases, and scientific literature.
Assembly of these models is an iterative tasks from the community.
Citations and dates of major progresses on the model of human metabolism (recon 1, recon 2, recon 2.2).
As human metabolic models improve, they demonstrate utility in predictions and analyses of -omics data.
As examples, both liver studies (Mardinoglu 2017, Pagliarini 2016) utilized human metabolic models to predict therapeutic targets in liver disease.
Both studies validated the efficacy of these targets in mice and/or human patients.

----------
Slide 7

Note
The metabolic network has major hubs, metabolites that participate in an exceptionally great count of reactions.
I summarized the participation of all metabolites in reactions.
The greatest major hubs are proton and water among the most prolific 1% of metabolites.
Prolific metabolites like proton and water are probably not interesting in the context of experimentation.
In contrast 2-oxoglutarate, pyruvate, and glucose are also hubs that are likely relevant and interesting.

----------
Slide 8

Note
I defined a network from information from the model of human metabolism.
I used my application to draw a custom representation of this network.
Iterative simulations of forces drive the arrangement of nodes and links.
What does this network look like?
"Wow. It is so beautiful."
"Early on I observed that there seems to be the shape of a person in the network."

Nodes: 12329
Links: 42932

This network of human metabolism demonstrates obvious modularity, with distinct modules, groups, clusters, or communities.
These modules have dense relations within themselves but sparse relations to other modules.
These modules also have their own hubs.
The network is still connected.
This network represents compartmentalization in the metabolic network, and this compartmentalization accounts for much of this modularity.

----------
Slide 9

Note
I also defined a network without consideration of subcellular compartmentalization.
Defining the network without compartmentalization is useful in experimental contexts that disregard compartments, such as whole-cell metabolomics.
This network demonstrates less modularity and instead connectivity is apparent.
This network has major, central hubs.

Nodes: 6043
Links: 28671

----------
Slide 10

Note
Study of metabolism at local, specific scope.
Design of experiments and interpretation of results require information about individual metabolites and reactions (genes, transcripts, proteins).
The local network in this example gives names and relations for the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction.
We know identities of entities, which metabolites are reactants and products, and the directionality and reversibility of the reaction.

A challenge is to access different types of information about the metabolic network at various scopes or levels of detail.
I will illustrate this challenge with an example.

Slide 11

Note
KEGG Atlas is currently among the most capable and common tools for studying the metabolic network.
It represents metabolism in static maps.
These maps organizes portions of metabolism separately and represents these with emphatic modularity by pathways or processes.
These representations simplify metabolism.
Static maps provide spatial reference.
Modules, such as compartments and processes, provide categories to reduce scale and simplify understanding.

----------
Slide 12

Note
Static representations of metabolism tend to favor some types of information at the expense of others.
KEGG's static maps do not represent compartmentalization.
They also obscure relations between different categories.
Pyruvate's direct relations to other metabolites spread across a substantial portion of the map and are obscure.
Replication of central metabolites.
Proximity is an example of information that static representations sometimes obscure.

----------
Slide 13

Note
A challenge also arises when relations across typical categories become relevant.
Janet Lindsley told me about some examples of human metabolic diseases that involve perturbations across common pathways.

1. Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase Deficiency
Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase (OTC) in the mitochondrion normally routes carbamoyl phosphate through the Urea Cycle to dispose of ammonia.
Deficiency in OTC causes carbamoyl phosphate to accumulate in both the mitochondrion and the cytosol.
In the cytosol the excess carbamoyl phosphate routes through Pyrimidine Synthesis and causes accumulation of intermediate orotic acid.
Symptoms of the disease include hyperammonemia and orotic acidemia.

2. Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1
Hypoglycemia, Hyperuricemia and Gout
Glucose-6-Phosphatase normally allows glucose from Gluconeogenesis in the liver to escape cells into the bloodstream.
Deficiency in Glucose-6-Phosphatase traps glucose in cells.
The excess glucose routes through Pentose Phosphate Pathway and Purine Synthesis. Excess purines route through Purine Degradation and cause accumulation of uric acid.
Symptoms of the disease include hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, and gout.

3. Cancer
Cancer is a diverse and complex disease.
Perturbations in normal metabolism, such as central catabolism, favor synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and fats.

Note
Introduction to method
My team and I chose to implement our tool as a web application.
The web is the dominant application platform due to ease of development and deployment.
Web applications run within the browser (Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox, Apple's Safari, Window's Internet Explorer) on the user's machine.
A server is unnecessary.
The user will navigate to a web address and begin to use the application.
JavaScript is the standard programming language for behavior in web applications and is arguably the most popular and common programming language in the world.
JavaScript is especially powerful for dynamic, interactive interfaces.
Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a JavaScript library for visual representation of information in web documents.
D3 is powerful and versatile to support many types of custom visualizations.
D3 is among the most popular collections of open-source software, and is especially prominent in information visualization for The New York Times.
JSNetworkX is a JavaScript port of the most popular graph library in Python.

Slide 16

Note
Description of tasks for the tool.

Selections of interest might include the metabolic network in its entirety, a single compartment or process, or portions around or between individual entities.
Filters by attributes and topological traversal will support these selections.
Representation or neglect of compartmentalization in the network also depends on interest.

Context within entirety simplifies selections and gives reference.
Depiction of cardinalities of individual entities within sets will provide this context.

Visual representation will communicate information about the network.
There are many types of information about the network.
Metabolites and reactions have attributes of their own and relations between them.
Prolific metabolites might require simplification either by replication or omission from the network.
Simulations of forces will arrange the network's elements.
Sets of entities with common compartments and processes are favorable for aggregation and clear representation.

Visual representation of experimental data for metabolites or reactions in the context of the network.
Support identification of custom selections of metabolites or reactions.
Support custom values for metabolites or reactions.
Represent measurements' values by color saturation of nodes.

Slide 17

Note
To start my project, I selected a small model of metabolism from Escherichia coli.
I curated this model manually to select only the reactions and metabolites that are relevant to the Citrate Cycle.
I defined nodes for metabolites, special links for reactions, and links between them.
Biologists are familiar with the Citrate Cycle, and we know that this process behaves like a cycle.
So, what is this messy tangle of metabolites and reactions?
Metabolism is a lot messier than biologists usually represent it.
Many figures of metabolic pathways ignore all but the most relevant metabolites and reactions.
I began to consider ways that I could simplify representations of metabolic networks in ways that are still accurate.

Note
Replication of nodes for metabolites that are prolific hubs simplified the network.
The network resembles a cycle for the relevant metabolites.

----------
Slide 20

Note
Organization of the information allows me to work on its visual representation.
When I first visualized a substantial portion of the network, it was a bit overwhelming.
I visualized a proximity network around pyruvate at a depth of just 3 reactions.

I developed the application's ability to select portions of interest.
This example shows the portion of the Fatty Acid Oxidation process within only the Endoplasmic Reticular compartment.

Slide 23

Note
The application summarizes the entire metabolic network in terms of cardinalities of entities (metabolites and reactions) within sets by attributes of processes and compartments.
This summary is also a menu for selection and will include labels and search menus.

The application represents nodes for entities and relations between them.
The representation attempts to clarify a reaction's directionality and reversibility.
The application supports definition of the network with or without compartmentalization.
The application will also support either replication or omission of nodes for metabolites that are prolific hubs.
In its current state of development, I need to restore this functionality.
The arrangement of nodes and links is automatic and accommodates networks in a broad range of scales.

At its current state, the application consists of 8960 lines of code.

Slide 24

Note
At various points in this presentation, I have illustrated several functions of the application in its current state.
My short-term (1 month) goal for this project is to implement controls in the application's interface for all current functionality and to improve performance and latency.
Then I can deploy a prototype to my team members and gather feedback.
My middle-term (3 months) goal for this project is to implement novel functionality to support all tasks.
