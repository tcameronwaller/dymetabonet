Slide 2

Note
Introduction of metabolism, metabolic regulation, and their study.
Metabolism is a collective system of all chemical reactions in an organism that are necessary for survival, growth, and reproduction.
Regulation within this system differentiates between many states of health and disease.
Metabolic diseases in humans include obesity, diabetes, cancer, and death.
Death involves complete disregulation of metabolism.
The study of metabolism is relevant to human health.
Metabolism's complexity is a challenge, especially as accurate context is important.

Slide 3

Note
Introduction of the metabolic network.
A network is an abstract representation of relations (links) between entities (nodes).
Metabolism behaves like a network of reactions between metabolites.
Metabolites are small, biologically-relevant molecules.
Reactions involve roles of genes, transcripts, and proteins for encoding, catalysis, and regulation.
Define different types of nodes for metabolites and reactions with links between them.
Metabolites and their reactions segregate between cellular compartments, organelles.
Sets of reactions behave cooperatively in pathways or processes.

Note
Introduction of the metabolic model or reconstruction.
Metabolic models are compilations of information from scientific literature, genomic annotation, and homologous comparison to other species.
Citations and dates of major progresses on the model of human metabolism (recon 1, recon 2, recon 2.2).
Counts of metabolites, reactions, processes, and compartments in each model.
Summary of the raw data within the metabolic model.
Counts of metabolites, reactions, compartments, and processes.

Slide 5

Note
I defined a network from information from the model of human metabolism.
I used my application to draw a custom representation of this network.
Iterative simulations of forces drive the arrangement of nodes and links.
What does this network look like?
"Wow. It is so beautiful."
"Early on I observed that there seems to be the shape of a person in the network."

Slide 6

Note
Study of metabolism at global, holistic scope
Computational methods permit global analysis of the metabolic network and inform relevant observations.
Biological networks tend to be small-world and scale-free, with a few nodes as central hubs that minimize paths between many other nodes.
In a metabolic network, a hub might be a central metabolite such as pyruvate.
Modularity in metabolism involves compartments and pathways or processes that divide the system into smaller subsystems.
Continuity in metabolism involves transports and cross-pathway reactions that connect all subsystems into a cooperative whole.
Metabolism behaves as a cooperative, continuous system that also demonstrates modular specialization.
Implications for evolution and regulation.

Balance between modularity and continuity.
The metabolic network has properties of both modularity and continuity.
Both are relevant to the study of metabolism.
Compartments and pathways or processes provide categorical bins to reduce the scale of the system.
Modularity simplifies conceptual understanding of metabolism.
Examples include Gene and Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis.

Slide 7

Note
This network of human metabolism demonstrates obvious modularity, with distinct modules, groups, clusters, or communities.
These groups have dense relations within themselves but sparse relations to other groups.
These groups also have their own hubs.
The network is still continuous, however.
This network represents compartmentalization in the metabolic network, and this compartmentalization accounts for much of this modularity.

Slide 8

Note
I also defined a network without consideration of subcellular compartmentalization.
This network demonstrates less modularity and instead appears very continuous.
This network has major, central hubs.

----------
Slide 9

Note
The metabolic network has major hubs, metabolites that participate in an exceptionally great count of reactions.
I summarized the participation of all metabolites in reactions.
The greatest major hubs are proton and water.
Prolific metabolites like proton and water are probably not interesting in the context of experimentation.
In contrast, pyruvate is also a hub ranked 54, that is interesting.
I omitted the top 1% of metabolites from the network to reduce excessive connectivity.

Slide 12

Note
Study of metabolism at local, specific scope.
Design of experiments and interpretation of results require information about individual metabolites, genes, transcripts, and proteins.
A challenge is to access information about the metabolic network at various scopes or levels of detail.

KEGG Atlas represents modularity in metabolism in terms of pathways or processes.
Modularity provides categorical bins to reduce scale and simplify conceptual understanding.

Note
Janet Lindsley collaborated with a team at Stanford to develop a clear and communicable map of metabolism.
Representations of metabolism in static maps (spatial reference) with modularity (compartments and processes) are simple, understandable, and memorable.

Metabolism has information at global and local scopes.
Metabolism has both modularity and continuity.
Metabolism has various states in health and disease.

Goal is to explore metabolism dynamically from global to local scope with accurate representation of both modularity and continuity.

Slide 19

Note
Introduction to method
My team and I chose to implement our program as a web application.
The web is the dominant application platform due to ease of development and deployment.
Web applications run within the browser (Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox, Apple's Safari, Window's Internet Explorer) on the user's machine.
JavaScript is the standard programming language for behavior in web applications and is arguably the most popular and common programming language in the world.
Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a JavaScript library for visual representation of information in web documents.
D3 is powerful and versatile to support many types of custom visualizations.
Among the most popular collections of open-source software, D3 is especially prominent in information visualization from The New York Times.
JSNetworkX is a JavaScript port of the most popular graph library in Python.
