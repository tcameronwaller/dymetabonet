Slide 2

Note
Introduction of metabolism, metabolic regulation, and their study.
Metabolism is a collective system of all chemical reactions in an organism that are necessary for survival, growth, and reproduction.
The bodies of complex organisms like animals have distinct types of tissues with distinct types of cells that specialize in parts of metabolism.
An example of a metabolic reaction is the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase or glucokinase that traps glucose within the cell and commits it to glycolysis or glycogen synthesis.
Glucokinase predominates in the liver and has a lesser affinity for glucose in order to regulate storage in states of abundance.
Regulation within metabolism differentiates between many states of health and disease.
Metabolic diseases in humans include obesity, diabetes, cancer, and death.
Death involves complete disregulation of metabolism.
The study of metabolism is relevant to human health.
Metabolism's complexity is a challenge, especially as accurate context is important.

Slide 3

Note
Introduction of the metabolic network.
A network is an abstract representation of relations (links) between entities (nodes).
It is a model for data.
Metabolism behaves like a network of reactions between metabolites.
Define different types of nodes for metabolites and reactions with links between them.
Nodes and links possess attributes or properties.
Metabolites are small, biologically-relevant molecules.
Reactions involve roles of genes, transcripts, and proteins for encoding, catalysis, and regulation.
Metabolites and their reactions segregate between cellular compartments, organelles.
Sets of reactions behave cooperatively in pathways or processes.

Metabolic models are compilations of information from scientific literature, genomic annotation, and homologous comparison to other species.
Citations and dates of major progresses on the model of human metabolism (recon 1, recon 2, recon 2.2).
Counts of metabolites, reactions, processes, and compartments in each model.
Summary of the raw data within the metabolic model.
Counts of metabolites, reactions, compartments, and processes.

Slide 5

Note
I defined a network from information from the model of human metabolism.
I used my application to draw a custom representation of this network.
Iterative simulations of forces drive the arrangement of nodes and links.
What does this network look like?
"Wow. It is so beautiful."
"Early on I observed that there seems to be the shape of a person in the network."

Slide 6 [priority]

Note
Study of metabolism at global, holistic scope
Computational methods permit global analysis of the metabolic network and inform relevant observations.
Biological networks tend to be small-world and scale-free, with a few nodes as central hubs that minimize paths between many other nodes.
In a metabolic network, a hub might be a central metabolite such as pyruvate.
Modularity in metabolism involves compartments and pathways or processes that divide the system into smaller subsystems.
Continuity in metabolism involves transports and cross-pathway reactions that connect all subsystems into a cooperative whole.
Metabolism behaves as a cooperative, continuous system that also demonstrates modular specialization.
Implications for evolution and regulation.

Balance between modularity and continuity.
The metabolic network has properties of both modularity and continuity.
Both are relevant to the study of metabolism.
Compartments and pathways or processes provide categorical bins to reduce the scale of the system.
Modularity simplifies conceptual understanding of metabolism.
Examples include Gene and Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis.

----------
Slide 7

Note
The metabolic network has major hubs, metabolites that participate in an exceptionally great count of reactions.
I summarized the participation of all metabolites in reactions.
The greatest major hubs are proton and water among the most prolific 1% of metabolites.
Prolific metabolites like proton and water are probably not interesting in the context of experimentation.
In contrast 2-oxoglutarate, pyruvate, and glucose are also hubs that are likely relevant and interesting.

----------
Slide 8

Note
This network of human metabolism demonstrates obvious modularity, with distinct modules, groups, clusters, or communities.
These groups have dense relations within themselves but sparse relations to other groups.
These groups also have their own hubs.
The network is still continuous, however.
This network represents compartmentalization in the metabolic network, and this compartmentalization accounts for much of this modularity.

Slide 9

Note
I also defined a network without consideration of subcellular compartmentalization.
This network demonstrates less modularity and instead appears very continuous.
This network has major, central hubs.

Slide 10

Note
Study of metabolism at local, specific scope.
Design of experiments and interpretation of results require information about individual metabolites, genes, transcripts, and proteins.
A challenge is to access different types of information about the metabolic network at various scopes or levels of detail.
I will illustrate this challenge with an example.

----------
Slide 11

Note
KEGG Atlas is among the most capable and common tools for studying the metabolic network.
It organizes portions of metabolism separately and represents these in static maps with emphatic modularity of pathways or processes.
These representations simplify metabolism.
Static maps provide spatial reference.
Modules, such as compartments and processes, provide categories to reduce scale and simplify understanding.
A challenge arises when relations across typical categories become relevant.

Slide 12

Note
Janet Lindsley told me about some fascinating examples of human metabolic diseases that involve perturbations across traditional pathways.

1. Hyperammonemia, Orotic Acidemia
Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase (OTC) in the mitochondrion normally routes carbamoyl phosphate through the Urea Cycle to dispose of ammonia.
Deficiency in OTC causes carbamoyl phosphate to accumulate in both the mitochondrion and the cytosol.
In the cytosol the excess carbamoyl phosphate routes through Pyrimidine Synthesis and causes accumulation of intermediate orotic acid.
People with deficiency in OTC have accumulation of ammonia and orotic acid throughout the body.

2. Hypoglycemia, Hyperuricemia and Gout
Glucose-6-Phosphatase allows glucose from Gluconeogenesis in the liver to escape cells into the bloodstream.
Deficiency in Glucose-6-Phosphatase traps glucose in cells.
The excess glucose routes through Pentose Phosphate Pathway and Purine Synthesis and causes accumulation of uric acid.
People with deficiency in Glucose-6-Phosphatase have hypoglycemia and also have accumulation of uric acid.

3. Cancer

Slide 13

Note
Representations of metabolism tend to favor some types of information at the expense of others.
KEGG's static maps do not represent compartmentalization.
They also obscure relations between different categories.
Pyruvate's direct relations to other metabolites spread across a substantial portion of the map and are obscure.
Replication of central metabolites.

Slide 19

Note
Introduction to method
My team and I chose to implement our program as a web application.
The web is the dominant application platform due to ease of development and deployment.
Web applications run within the browser (Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox, Apple's Safari, Window's Internet Explorer) on the user's machine.
JavaScript is the standard programming language for behavior in web applications and is arguably the most popular and common programming language in the world.
Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a JavaScript library for visual representation of information in web documents.
D3 is powerful and versatile to support many types of custom visualizations.
Among the most popular collections of open-source software, D3 is especially prominent in information visualization from The New York Times.
JSNetworkX is a JavaScript port of the most popular graph library in Python.

Slide 20

Note
To start my project, I selected a small model of metabolism from Escherichia coli.
I curated this model manually to select only the reactions and metabolites that are relevant to the Citrate Cycle.
I defined nodes for metabolites, special links for reactions, and links between them.
Biologists are familiar with the Citrate Cycle, and we know that this process behaves like a cycle.
So, what is this messy tangle of metabolites and reactions?
Metabolism is a lot more messy than biologists usually represent it.
Many figures of metabolic pathways ignore all but the most relevant metabolites and reactions.
I began to consider ways that I could simplify representations of metabolic networks in ways that are still accurate.

Tell brief story about the challenge in scaling up to the complete data.
I eventually rendered the data usable at the scale of the entire model.
The scale was a bit overwhelming.
