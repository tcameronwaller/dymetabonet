Networks are extremely pervasive in many forms.
They even surround you in your daily life.
You participate in social networks, communication networks, and transportation networks.
All of these involve relationships between people, information, or places, respectively.

In networks that are large and complex, it can be a challenge to access specific information of interest.
Especially for spatial networks, such as transportation networks, scanning a map is intuitive.
Another way to find relevant information is to use queries or searches.
This method is especially useful for non-spatial networks, for which maps are less intuitive.

You are also part of a biological network, known as metabolism.
Well, really it is a part of you.
Metabolism sustains life and all of its diverse processes, from the release of energy in food to the synthesis of genomes.
It is a network of relationships between genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, and most of these relationships occur within the tiny cells in your body.

Since the cellular environment is so complex, the metabolic network is not really spatial like places on a map.
For example, image in your home was really thousands of identical homes in different places simultaneously.
It would be difficult to find your home on a map, would it not?

[Demonstration: Select sub models 4, 3, 2, 1 ... 00:14]
"The user selects a metabolic model, and the program generates a corresponding network.
From this network, nodes representing metabolites and links representing reactions appear in a node-link diagram."

[00:50]

[00:52]
[Demonstration: Hold cursor over nodes (3 metabolites and 1 reaction) ... 00:010]
"Information from the model, such as names of metabolites and reactions, associates with corresponding nodes and links."

[01:03]
[Demonstration: Click and drag nodes to new positions (3 reactions and 1 metabolite ... 00:10]
"The layout of this diagram is automatic and dynamic in order to represent diverse metabolic networks clearly.
It is also possible to change the positions of nodes and links manually for a custom layout."

[01:15]
[Demonstration: Release nodes ... 00:07]
"In the metabolic network, some metabolites participate in many reactions such that they have high degrees.
These metabolites complicate the node-link diagram."

[01:25]
[Demonstration: Replicate water ... 00:07]
"If a metabolite with a high degree is less interesting, it is possible to replicate its node."

[01:32]
[Demonstration: Replicate common nodes of citrate cycle ... 00:20]
"Users who are familiar with biology will recognize metabolites that are especially prevalent in metabolism.
These metabolites may be good candidates for replication.
This replication can simplify the node-link diagram, clarifying relationships between other metabolites and the overall structure of the network."
