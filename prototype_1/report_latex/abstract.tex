% Abstract

Metabolic networks are large and complex, involving many types of relations between many types of entities.
Biologists and clinicians need access to the information from these networks in order to interpret experimental data that inform the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.
The goal of this project is to develop methods that enable users to explore the metabolic network.
In contrast to many existing technologies, this project employs automatic, dynamic layouts to represent subsets of the network.
In future projects, these dynamic layouts will be necessary to represent subsets of the network that the user specifies by custom queries.
