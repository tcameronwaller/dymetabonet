Escher
Users can load metabolic models.
The interface facilitates using the information from the metabolic models to draw metabolic maps manually.
The end result is a map with a static layout of a user-defined/annotated metabolic pathway.
The nodes and links of the map are encoded so that the user can associate experimental data with the map and visualize these data on the map.
Escher relies on human interaction to visualize manually-selected subsets of metabolism.

Escher uses JavaScript.

GeneMania
http://genemania.org/
Nice web-based interface for multiple dimensions of networks between genes.
The selection between network types is a nice model.
GeneMania is built on Cytoscape.
GeneMania has a nice interface.
